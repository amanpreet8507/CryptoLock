The explosive growth of Internet communications and data storage on Internet-connected computers has greatly increased privacy concerns. 
The field of cryptography is concerned with coding data to make it difficult (and hopefully—with the most advanced schemes— impossible) for unauthorized users to read. 
In this application I investigated a simple scheme for encrypting and decrypting data. 
A company that wants to send data over the Internet has asked you to write a program that will encrypt the data so that it may be transmitted more securely. 
All the data is transmitted as four-digit integers. My application reads a four-digit integer entered by the user and encrypt it and print it.
What I researched "public key cryptography" in general and the PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) specific public-key scheme. I also looked at the RSA(Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) scheme, which is widely used in industrial-strength applications.
